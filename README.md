How to create a Blog?
step 1: 
    Go to "lib" folder >> open "blogs.ts"
step 2: 
    Inside the Blogpost[], you can see all the posts we have before. 
    Copy a post, and paste it below to create a new post.
step 3: 
    Inside this post give all the infomations like, slug, title, author, date, category(see step 4), image, a short intro title and content, html path (see step 5), finally, In the featured, if it is features, give "true", else give "false"
step 4: 
    To choose the category, go to "components >> 'blogs-2-page.tsx'". 
    In the line 45 you can see all the categories. 
    Use one of them or if you want to create new one, create it here.
step 5: 
    for the html path, you need to first create a blog file. 
    I already have the template. Just paste the content in it. 
    Go to components >> Blogs. The template will be there in "BlogTemplate.tsx". 
Step 6: 
    Step by step to create the blog page: 
        Click on the folder name "app".
            create a new folder inside it with the name like blog-1...(something not already created!!) 
            Next create a "page.tsx" file in side that folder. 
        copy the content inside the "BlogTemplate.tsx" and paste it inside the new file you created. 
        In this file instead of the text and paragraph already there, paste your content and adjust as you like.
Step 7: 
    After creating the file, note the folder's name(eg., blog-1)  go back to "lib >> blogs.ts", In the blog, write the folder's name. "blog-1". That's it.
